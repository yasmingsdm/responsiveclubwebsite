# Responsive Club Website

This project goal was to build a club group page that will dynamically respond as you adjust the size of your screen!   
This is a CodeAcademy project for the Front-end Engineer Career Path so I choose to copy [this](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/independent-practice-projects/responsive-club-site/example-site/index.html?_gl=1*7b4ona*_ga*NTEzNzQzNDM5OS4xNjY4MTYyMTI4*_ga_3LRZM6TM9L*MTY3NzU4NzM1My4xMjYuMS4xNjc3NTg4MTIzLjAuMC4w)  homepage from CodeAcademy Project


I used HTML and CSS.

#### What I've practiced/learned:
- Copy a homepage;
- Anchor to the same page (HTML);
- Use the width of the page (CSS);
- Grid (CSS);
- Flexbox (CSS);
- Responsive design (CSS).
